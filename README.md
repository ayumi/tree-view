# Tree View Bottom package

Explore and open files in the current project.

Hacked to display on bottom because that's cool.

Press `cmd-\` to open/close the Tree view and `ctrl-0` to focus it.

When the Tree view has focus you can press `a`, `m`, or `delete` to add, move
or delete files and folders.
